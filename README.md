# Hulu Clone

This is my first project, a clone of the Hulu streaming service interface.

## Description

This project is a simple clone of Hulu, designed to showcase popular movies using The Movie Database (TMDb) API. It is built with React and styled with custom CSS. The application fetches data from the TMDb API and displays movie information, including posters, titles, descriptions, ratings, and release dates.

## Features

## Acknowledgements
